Creating a Clojure web-application without setting your hair on fire

* Introduction

* Clojure Builds Tool
** Leningen - Which I'm going to use for this demonstration
** Boot

* IDE's
** EMACS + CiDer
** Lighttable
** Visual Code

* Creating a simple web application
- Using two clojure libraries, Ring and built ontop of this Compojure
- Create a new web-application using leiningen
- lein new compojure costain-techtalk
- Open the file project.clj to see the project file including depdencies
- Dependency management is carried out using maven behind the scenes
- The web-application can be run using lein and ring on an embedded Jetty Server
- We can also created a self contained jar
- lein ring uberjar

** Rendering views
*** Request mapping user handler, add new mapping
*** Make the output look nice using hiccup
**** Using library https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup
**** Import the library into the project [hiccup "1.0.5"]
**** Use the library in out handler [hiccup.page :as h]
**** Make the handler return some html
(h/html5
[:head [:title "Tech Talk"]]
[:body ""])

** Handling Request Parameters
*** As parth variables
*** As request parameters using de-construction


** Returning responses as JSON
